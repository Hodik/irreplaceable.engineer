Your task is to **observe and understand** the codebase for the subject

## Guidelines

1. **Exploration Only** - Do NOT:
   - Debug specific issues
   - Create plans for new features
   - Propose fixes or changes
   - Generate implementation tasks

2. **Focus On** - DO:
   - Explore existing patterns and design decisions
   - Map relationships between components
   - Understand architectural choices
   - Document data flows and dependencies
   - Identify conventions and practices
   - Note how different modules interact

3. **Prepare to Discuss**:
   - Summarize your findings in a clear, structured way
   - Be ready to answer questions about what you observed
   - Present trade-offs and rationale behind design choices
   - Explain the "why" and "how" of the current implementation

4. **Update Docs**:
    - Read docs/ folowing @docs.mdc rule
    - Check if any of the docs needs updating or extending and only put new information to any of them if it's not yet covered and fits docs file's purpose 

## Output Format

Present your observations as:

### Architecture & Design
- High-level patterns used
- Design principles evident in the code

### Component Relationships
- How modules/classes interact
- Key dependencies and data flows

### Conventions & Patterns
- Coding patterns consistently used
- Naming conventions
- Common abstractions

### Notable Decisions
- Interesting architectural choices
- Trade-offs that were made
- Framework/library usage patterns
